Part 1: Theoretical Questions -

    1.  A video game - Where different user-level-threads are handling
        different aspects in the game. One thread could handle the user input,
        while another handles a game object, and a third thread handles
        rendering the image to the screen. In a fast-pacing game, we could take
        advantage of the low overhead involve in a user-level-threads as
        apposed to kernel-level-thread or a process,
        resulting in a much smoother user experience.

    2.  Advantages - The different tabs a totally separated at the hardware
        level. so, if one tab or website crashes of is infected with a malware,
        the rest of the tabs and system are safe.
        We will get a more secure experience and less prone to disruptions.
        Disadvantages - Because of the overhead involved in switching process,
        the overall program will run less smoothly, and many more resources
        will be exhausted by the program (high RAM usage).
